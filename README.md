  # Reflection
  > I've learned about PC assemble before but only on online platform. In this PC maintenance workshop, I can enhance my skill in PC maintenance. The thing that surprised me is that when assembling a PC, we can't be too gentle because some computer components require some pressure to work properly.

  # About
  > During clarity tech work industrial talk, all speakers have shared the overview of job scope, technology used, difference between the experience of work life and study life, essential skills required during work and their advice for university students.
  # What have I learned
  > From the advice of ex-CTO of Clarity Techworks, no matter how well you do in your job, bad attitude will not only waste our talent, but it will also ruin the whole comunitry dynamic. This emphasize while skills are important, they are not enough on their own. Without  a great attitude someone’s talent will be wasted and disrupt the group effort. Achieving success in this fast-paced era of technology, the companies require strong soft skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and ability to adapt in different conditions.

  >Other than that, self-learning and continuous improvement are important for anyone who desires success in this rapidly evolving technological world. We should not always rely on others for guidance, it is high time for us to embrace the challenges by taking step out of our comfort zone. Since the competition keeps rising surpass the limit, we required to keep striving independently to achieve a great and successful career in the future.

  >Lastly, communication and analytic thinking are also important in providing innovation and efficiency in IT-related jobs. These skills are essential for effective problem-solving for beginners as they need to survive in this technology-driven world which can be quite stressful

  # What I've learned
  > Visiting UTM Digital gives us huge opportunities to explore how an organization similar to UTM Digital works. After visiting UTM Digital, it gives me great view of computer science, these activities show me the diversity of computer science in industry. During the UTM Digital visit, I learnt how important the teamwork. Every staff member in UTM Digital has their own task, each task needs to be completed to make sure UTM Digital is running smoothly. The visit of UTM Digital are really exciting, knows job that are related to my course, and how an important asset of UTM work from the inside. These activities really help me to understand why it is important to know certain skills during the learning and teaching process. These skills learnt in the classroom is applied directly and indirectly in the industry. Lastly, the visit to UTM Digital is amazing, the staff are friendly and open to any question we ask. During our interview with one of the UTM Digital’s staff, he shows a great personality. He answered the questions we asked well and was easy to understand. I hope we will have this opportunity again to visit UTM Digital.

  # Introduction
  > Design thinking is a way of approach to solving problems that emphasizes the understanding of creating a product that fits the user’s need and desire, encouraging inventiveness and also developing innovation as a solution for some analyzed obstacles. This is quite crucial as design thinking is more to human-centered innovation which is highly focused on empathy where the innovators need to analyze the problem that is being faced by some of the targeted groups and come up with a mind-blowing solution that relieves the burden of the user. There are five phases of design thinking that should be considered to make this project successful.

 > During our Design Thinking project, we were assigned to analyze problems do disadvantages group faces daily. After long discussion and consideration, we decided to develop Evercare for our Design Thinking project. A wonderful application that have the ability to solve each problem of elderly people in managing their health. bBy utilizing modern technology, “Evercare”  provides complete healthcare solutions that designed specifically based on the needs of elderly people to ensure them to live an independent lifestyle

# What I've learned
> During the Industrial Talk I found Wi-Fi 6 and 5G are the revolution in the connectivity field. 5G provides ultra-low latency, high speeds, and is going to create a full revolution for industries like healthcare and smart cities. Wi-Fi 6 brings network efficiency, thereby allowing more and more devices to coexist inside dense environs. Both complement each other, 5G for wide-area coverage, while Wi-Fi 6 acts for local networks. Therefore, it became a must to provide unlimited bound for us to keep innovating.
